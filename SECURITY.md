## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

| < 1.0   | :x: (pre-release)  |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report privately via one of:

- GitHub Security Advisories on this repository
  (Security tab → "Report a vulnerability"), or
- Email the maintainers (see repository profile for contact).

Please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions / platforms
- Your assessment of impact (optional)

## What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within **72 hours**.
- A fix or mitigation plan for confirmed issues, prioritized by severity.
- Public disclosure only after a fix is available, coordinated with the reporter.

## Scope Notes

ZenCode executes code and accesses API keys by design. The threat model
assumes the operator trusts the machine ZenCode runs on. Out of scope:

- Social-engineering or phishing against operators
- Vulnerabilities in third-party model providers (report to them directly)
- Denial-of-service via local resource exhaustion (documented limitation)

## Dependency Security

- `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` run in CI. New dependencies must pass both.
- Prefer minimal, well-maintained crates. Avoid new dependencies unless necessary.
